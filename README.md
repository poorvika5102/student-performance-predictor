# üéì Student Performance Predictor

This is a machine learning project that predicts whether a student is likely to **pass or fail** based on their academic habits and lifestyle factors.

üöÄ Built with **Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit**, this project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, build ML models, and deploy them through interactive web apps ‚Äî showcasing my AI/ML skills.

## üí° Features

- Random Forest model with 85%+ accuracy
- Real-time predictions via Streamlit app
- Input features: study time, failures, absences, health, and free time
- Clean ML pipeline: preprocessing ‚Üí training ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí deployment
